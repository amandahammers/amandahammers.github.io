Hello

I'm Amanda Hammers and this is a website I created during my STT 2860 class, which focuses on Data Management and Visualization. 

I'm a Psychology major, but I wanted to try learning about data analysis and coding and visualizing in case it can help me in the future, and because it seems interesting.
