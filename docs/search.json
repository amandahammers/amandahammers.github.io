It looks like there are 33 variables.\nIn order for me to better understand what I’m looking at, I’m going to give a description of each variable:\n\nTimestamp: Date and time when form was submitted in MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS format\nAge: Respondent’s age, in years\nPrimary.streaming.service: Respondent’s primary streaming service (“Spotify”, “Pandora”, “YouTube Music”, etc.)\nHours.per.day: Number of hours the respondent listens to music per day, in .5 increments\nWhile.working: If respondent listens to music while studying/working or not (“Yes”/“No”)\nInstrumentalist: If respondent plays an instrument regularly or not (“Yes”/“No”)\nComposer: If respondent regularly composes music or not (“Yes”/“No”)\nFav.genre: Respondent’s favorite or top genre (“Pop”, “Video Game Music”, “Rap”, etc.)\nExploratory: If respondent actively explores new artists/genres (“Yes”/“No”)\nForeign.languages: If respondent regularly listens to music with lyrics in a language they are not fluent in (“Yes”/“No”)\nBPM: beats per minute of favorite genre\nFrequency..Classical.: How frequently respondent listens to classical music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..Country.: How frequently respondent listens to country music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..EDM.: How frequently respondent listens to EDM music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..Folk.: How frequently respondent listens to Folk music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..Gospel.: How frequently respondent listens to Gospel music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..Hip.hop.: How frequently respondent listens to Hip Hop music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..Jazz.: How frequently respondent listens to Jazz music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..K.pop.: How frequently respondent listens to K-Pop music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..Latin.: How frequently respondent listens to Latin music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..Lofi.: How frequently respondent listens to Lofi music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..Metal.: How frequently respondent listens to Metal music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..Pop.: How frequently respondent listens to Pop music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..R.B.: How frequently respondent listens to R&B music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..Rap.: How frequently respondent listens to Rap music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..Rock.: How frequently respondent listens to Rock music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..Video.game.music.: How frequently respondent listens to Video Game music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nAnxiety: Self-reported anxiety, on a scale of 0-10\nDepression: Self-reported depression, on a scale of 0-10\nInsomnia: Self-reported insomnia, on a scale of 0-10\nOCD: Self-reported OCD, on a scale of 0-10\nMusic.effects: If music improves, worsens, or has no effect on respondent’s mental health conditions (“Worsen”, “No Effect”, “Improve”)\nPermissions: Permissions to publicize data (“I understand”)\n\nOk cool. I have a better sense of what I’m working with now.\nFor the questions I’m looking to ask, I don’t think I need to keep the Timestamp or Permissions variables. So let’s get them out of my dataset.\n\nmxmh &lt;- results[,c(-1, -33)]\n\nnames(mxmh)\n\n [1] \"Age\"                          \"Primary.streaming.service\"   \n [3] \"Hours.per.day\"                \"While.working\"               \n [5] \"Instrumentalist\"              \"Composer\"                    \n [7] \"Fav.genre\"                    \"Exploratory\"                 \n [9] \"Foreign.languages\"            \"BPM\"                         \n[11] \"Frequency..Classical.\"        \"Frequency..Country.\"         \n[13] \"Frequency..EDM.\"              \"Frequency..Folk.\"            \n[15] \"Frequency..Gospel.\"           \"Frequency..Hip.hop.\"         \n[17] \"Frequency..Jazz.\"             \"Frequency..K.pop.\"           \n[19] \"Frequency..Latin.\"            \"Frequency..Lofi.\"            \n[21] \"Frequency..Metal.\"            \"Frequency..Pop.\"             \n[23] \"Frequency..R.B.\"              \"Frequency..Rap.\"             \n[25] \"Frequency..Rock.\"             \"Frequency..Video.game.music.\"\n[27] \"Anxiety\"                      \"Depression\"                  \n[29] \"Insomnia\"                     \"OCD\"                         \n[31] \"Music.effects\"               \n\n\nOk cool!

Do younger people listen on “Spotify”? Do older respondents listen on “Youtube” or “Apple Music”?\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Bar graph showing the primary streaming service of respondents, colored by age.\n\n\n\n\nThe data is very skewed for age, interesting. But it looks like Spotify is the most common streaming service across most ages. Apple Music and Youtube Music seem to follow after that.\nThe last thing for age I want to look at is how age and mental health is correlated. Are younger people struggling more than old people?\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Bar graphs showing distribution of mental health conditions across ages, faceted by age.\n\n\n\n\nMy graph looks a little rough, but it seems that respondents between 14-33 have the most variability and highest scores in their self-reported depression.\n\nmxmh_updatedages &lt;- mxmh %&gt;%\n  filter(Age &gt; 13, Age &lt;= 32) %&gt;%\n  count(Age)\n\nmxmh_updatedages  \n\n   Age  n\n1   14 17\n2   15 21\n3   16 44\n4   17 59\n5   18 85\n6   19 61\n7   20 40\n8   21 52\n9   22 39\n10  23 37\n11  24 20\n12  25 22\n13  26 22\n14  27 18\n15  28 13\n16  29 13\n17  30 11\n18  31 13\n19  32 16\n\n\nSince our data is so skewed towards younger respondents, I’m going to limit our respondents to those between the ages of 14 and 32.\n\nmxmh_cut &lt;- subset(mxmh, Age &gt;= 14 & Age &lt;= 32,\nselect=Age:Music.effects)\n\n\n\n\nNow that we’ve explored how age affects some of the results of the survey, let’s look at various aspects of the mental health part of this survey. I’m counting this as the self-report scores from the Anxiety, Depression, Insomnia, and OCD variables, and the Music.effects variable.\nFirst, I want to see if there are any mental health conditions that are more commonly self-reported by respondents.\n\n\n\n\n\nHistograms showing distribution of each mental health condition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistograms showing distribution of each mental health condition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistograms showing distribution of each mental health condition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistograms showing distribution of each mental health condition\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like Depression and Anxiety have the most self-reports, especially with higher scores, while OCD and Insomnia have higher amounts of self-reports at lower scores, generally.\nI have a few more questions related to some of these mental health conditions in specific. To start with, I’m curious if respondents with higher self-reported Insomnia listen to more music in a day than those who don’t.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Line graph showing hours of music per day and self-reported Insomnia score, colored by if music has an effect on mental health.\n\n\n\n\nOverall, not really. It increases slightly as the insomnia scores do and there’s several outliers, but nothing really significant.\nI want to see if there’s any correlation between different genres and the self-reported Depression scores.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Histogram showing breakdown of Depression self-report scores, colored by Fav.genre.\n\n\n\n\nInteresting, it seems to be evenly distributed among most genres, except for rock and metal music being more prominent. I wonder if I had gender data from my respondents if there would have been any more effects there.\nOne of the last questions about Mental Health I have is if there is a correlation between Anxiety and listening to new music while working. I know music can be very grounding, so I wonder if someone who has a high rating of anxiety would listen to it more while working.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Bar graph showing self-reported Anxiety, colored by if the respondent listened to music while studying or working.”\n\n\n\n\nSo, it does seem that the more people self-report anxiety, the more they listen to music while they work. However, it looks like this result might be because more people rated themselves higher in anxiety in general.\n\n\n\nAlmost there! I had one last question about the data I had. I want to see if different streaming services and different favorite genres overlap. Do the metalheads really love Pandora? Do the rap listeners stay away from Spotify?\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Histogram showing the different favorite genres of participants, colored by preferred streaming service.\n\n\n\n\nOk, cool! It looks like Spotify is overall the most popular, and a significant amount listen to pop music on Youtube music and listen to rock music not on a streaming service at all (maybe CDs?)\nI think that’s enough exploring this dataset for now. Overall, there were a lot of young people and a lot of people who listen on Spotify. The data set also saw a significant amount of people with high self-report scores of depression and anxiety. And a lot of people who listen to Rock music as well."

I have a better sense of what I’m working with now.\nFor the questions I’m looking to ask, I don’t think I need to keep the Timestamp or Permissions variables.

    "section": "",
    "text": "I have a few areas within the dataset that I’d like to explore, so let’s start with age.\n\n\nFirst, I want to make a general breakdown of the ages of our respondents.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A histogram showing the ages of respondents, in years.\n\n\n\n\nNow, I want to see if age can lead to significant differences in respondents’ answers to a couple of questions.\nThe first thing I want to look at is if the primary streaming service of a participant has anything to do with their age. Do younger people listen on “Spotify”? Do older respondents listen on “Youtube” or “Apple Music”?\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Bar graph showing the primary streaming service of respondents, colored by age.\n\n\n\n\nThe data is very skewed for age, interesting. But it looks like Spotify is the most common streaming service across most ages. Apple Music and Youtube Music seem to follow after that.\nThe last thing for age I want to look at is how age and mental health is correlated. Are younger people struggling more than old people?\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Bar graphs showing distribution of mental health conditions across ages, faceted by age.\n\n\n\n\nMy graph looks a little rough, but it seems that respondents between 14-33 have the most variability and highest scores in their self-reported depression.\n\nmxmh_updatedages &lt;- mxmh %&gt;%\n  filter(Age &gt; 13, Age &lt;= 32) %&gt;%\n  count(Age)\n\nmxmh_updatedages  \n\n   Age  n\n1   14 17\n2   15 21\n3   16 44\n4   17 59\n5   18 85\n6   19 61\n7   20 40\n8   21 52\n9   22 39\n10  23 37\n11  24 20\n12  25 22\n13  26 22\n14  27 18\n15  28 13\n16  29 13\n17  30 11\n18  31 13\n19  32 16\n\n\nSince our data is so skewed towards younger respondents, I’m going to limit our respondents to those between the ages of 14 and 32.\n\nmxmh_cut &lt;- subset(mxmh, Age &gt;= 14 & Age &lt;= 32,\nselect=Age:Music.effects)\n\n\n\n\nNow that we’ve explored how age affects some of the results of the survey, let’s look at various aspects of the mental health part of this survey. I’m counting this as the self-report scores from the Anxiety, Depression, Insomnia, and OCD variables, and the Music.effects variable.\nFirst, I want to see if there are any mental health conditions that are more commonly self-reported by respondents.\n\n\n\n\n\nHistograms showing distribution of each mental health condition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistograms showing distribution of each mental health condition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistograms showing distribution of each mental health condition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistograms showing distribution of each mental health condition\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like Depression and Anxiety have the most self-reports, especially with higher scores, while OCD and Insomnia have higher amounts of self-reports at lower scores, generally.\nI have a few more questions related to some of these mental health conditions in specific. To start with, I’m curious if respondents with higher self-reported Insomnia listen to more music in a day than those who don’t.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Line graph showing hours of music per day and self-reported Insomnia score, colored by if music has an effect on mental health.\n\n\n\n\nOverall, not really. It increases slightly as the insomnia scores do and there’s several outliers, but nothing really significant.\nI want to see if there’s any correlation between different genres and the self-reported Depression scores.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Histogram showing breakdown of Depression self-report scores, colored by Fav.genre.\n\n\n\n\nInteresting, it seems to be evenly distributed among most genres, except for rock and metal music being more prominent. I wonder if I had gender data from my respondents if there would have been any more effects there.\nOne of the last questions about Mental Health I have is if there is a correlation between Anxiety and listening to new music while working. I know music can be very grounding, so I wonder if someone who has a high rating of anxiety would listen to it more while working.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Bar graph showing self-reported Anxiety, colored by if the respondent listened to music while studying or working.”\n\n\n\n\nSo, it does seem that the more people self-report anxiety, the more they listen to music while they work. However, it looks like this result might be because more people rated themselves higher in anxiety in general.\n\n\n\nAlmost there! I had one last question about the data I had. I want to see if different streaming services and different favorite genres overlap. Do the metalheads really love Pandora? Do the rap listeners stay away from Spotify?\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Histogram showing the different favorite genres of participants, colored by preferred streaming service.\n\n\n\n\nOk, cool! It looks like Spotify is overall the most popular, and a significant amount listen to pop music on Youtube music and listen to rock music not on a streaming service at all (maybe CDs?)\nI think that’s enough exploring this dataset for now. Overall, there were a lot of young people and a lot of people who listen on Spotify. The data set also saw a significant amount of people with high self-report scores of depression and anxiety. And a lot of people who listen to Rock music as well."

It looks like there are 33 variables.\nIn order for me to better understand what I’m looking at, I’m going to give a description of each variable:\n\nTimestamp: Date and time when form was submitted in MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS format\nAge: Respondent’s age, in years\nPrimary.streaming.service: Respondent’s primary streaming service (“Spotify”, “Pandora”, “YouTube Music”, etc.)\nHours.per.day: Number of hours the respondent listens to music per day, in .5 increments\nWhile.working: If respondent listens to music while studying/working or not (“Yes”/“No”)\nInstrumentalist: If respondent plays an instrument regularly or not (“Yes”/“No”)\nComposer: If respondent regularly composes music or not (“Yes”/“No”)\nFav.genre: Respondent’s favorite or top genre (“Pop”, “Video Game Music”, “Rap”, etc.)\nExploratory: If respondent actively explores new artists/genres (“Yes”/“No”)\nForeign.languages: If respondent regularly listens to music with lyrics in a language they are not fluent in (“Yes”/“No”)\nBPM: beats per minute of favorite genre\nFrequency..Classical.: How frequently respondent listens to classical music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..Country.: How frequently respondent listens to country music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..EDM.: How frequently respondent listens to EDM music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..Folk.: How frequently respondent listens to Folk music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..Gospel.: How frequently respondent listens to Gospel music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..Hip.hop.: How frequently respondent listens to Hip Hop music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..Jazz.: How frequently respondent listens to Jazz music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..K.pop.: How frequently respondent listens to K-Pop music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..Latin.: How frequently respondent listens to Latin music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..Lofi.: How frequently respondent listens to Lofi music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..Metal.: How frequently respondent listens to Metal music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..Pop.: How frequently respondent listens to Pop music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..R.B.: How frequently respondent listens to R&B music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..Rap.: How frequently respondent listens to Rap music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..Rock.: How frequently respondent listens to Rock music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..Video.game.music.: How frequently respondent listens to Video Game music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nAnxiety: Self-reported anxiety, on a scale of 0-10\nDepression: Self-reported depression, on a scale of 0-10\nInsomnia: Self-reported insomnia, on a scale of 0-10\nOCD: Self-reported OCD, on a scale of 0-10\nMusic.effects: If music improves, worsens, or has no effect on respondent’s mental health conditions (“Worsen”, “No Effect”, “Improve”)\nPermissions: Permissions to publicize data (“I understand”)\n\nOk cool. I have a better sense of what I’m working with now.\nFor the questions I’m looking to ask, I don’t think I need to keep the Timestamp or Permissions variables.

Do younger people listen on “Spotify”? Do older respondents listen on “Youtube” or “Apple Music”?\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Bar graph showing the primary streaming service of respondents, colored by age.\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like Spotify is the most common streaming service across most ages. Apple Music and Youtube Music seem to follow after that.\nThe next thing for age I want to look at is how age and mental health is correlated. Are younger people struggling more than old people?\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Line graphs showing distribution of mental health conditions across ages, faceted by age.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to this, there are a lot of roughly 18-20 year olds with higher self-reports of depression. This could be because that age range has more depression, or due to the fact that we just have a lot of respondents that age.\nNow that we know what ages we have, what streaming services they use, and how theirmental health is, I want to look at how many hours per day respondents listen to music based on their age.\n\n\n\n\n\nLine graph showing the amount of music listened to per day in hours over age, in years, of respondent.\n\n\n\n\nSo, it looks like there’s some variability among how much music respondent’s listen to, but let’s move on to something else.\n\n\n\nNow that we’ve explored how age affects some of the results of the survey, let’s look at various aspects of the mental health part of this survey. I’m counting this as the self-report scores from the Anxiety, Depression, Insomnia, and OCD variables, and the Music.effects variable.\nFirst, I want to see if there are any mental health conditions that are more commonly self-reported by respondents.\n\n\n\n\n\nHistograms showing distribution of each mental health condition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistograms showing distribution of each mental health condition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistograms showing distribution of each mental health condition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistograms showing distribution of each mental health condition\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like Depression and Anxiety have the most self-reports, especially with higher scores, while OCD and Insomnia have higher amounts of self-reports at lower scores, generally.\nI have a few more questions related to some of these mental health conditions in specific. To start with, I’m curious if respondents with higher self-reported Insomnia listen to more music in a day than those who don’t.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Line graph showing hours of music per day and self-reported Insomnia score, colored by if music has an effect on mental health.\n\n\n\n\nOverall, not really. It increases slightly as the insomnia scores do and there’s several outliers, but nothing really significant.\nI want to see if there’s any correlation between different genres and the self-reported Depression scores.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Histogram showing breakdown of Depression self-report scores, colored by Fav.genre.\n\n\n\n\nInteresting, it seems to be evenly distributed among most genres, except for rock and metal music being more prominent. I wonder if I had gender data from my respondents if there would have been any more effects there.\nOne of the last questions about Mental Health I have is if there is a correlation between Anxiety and listening to new music while working. I know music can be very grounding, so I wonder if someone who has a high rating of anxiety would listen to it more while working.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Bar graph showing self-reported Anxiety, colored by if the respondent listened to music while studying or working.”\n\n\n\n\nSo, it does seem that the more people self-report anxiety, the more they listen to music while they work. However, it looks like this result might be because more people rated themselves higher in anxiety in general.\n\n\n\nAlmost there! I had one last question about the data I had. I want to see if different streaming services and different favorite genres overlap. Do the metalheads really love Pandora? Do the rap listeners stay away from Spotify?\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Histogram showing the different favorite genres of participants, colored by preferred streaming service.\n\n\n\n\nOk, cool! It looks like Spotify is overall the most popular, and a significant amount listen to pop music on Youtube music and listen to rock music not on a streaming service at all (maybe CDs?)\nI think that’s enough exploring this dataset for now. Overall, there were a lot of young people and a lot of people who listen on Spotify. The data set also saw a significant amount of people with high self-report scores of depression and anxiety. And a lot of people who listen to Rock music as well."

It looks like there are 33 variables.\nIn order for me to better understand what I’m looking at, I’m going to give a description of each variable:\n\nTimestamp: Date and time when form was submitted in MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS format\nAge: Respondent’s age, in years\nPrimary.streaming.service: Respondent’s primary streaming service (“Spotify”, “Pandora”, “YouTube Music”, etc.)\nHours.per.day: Number of hours the respondent listens to music per day, in .5 increments\nWhile.working: If respondent listens to music while studying/working or not (“Yes”/“No”)\nInstrumentalist: If respondent plays an instrument regularly or not (“Yes”/“No”)\nComposer: If respondent regularly composes music or not (“Yes”/“No”)\nFav.genre: Respondent’s favorite or top genre (“Pop”, “Video Game Music”, “Rap”, etc.)\nExploratory: If respondent actively explores new artists/genres (“Yes”/“No”)\nForeign.languages: If respondent regularly listens to music with lyrics in a language they are not fluent in (“Yes”/“No”)\nBPM: beats per minute of favorite genre\nFrequency..Classical.: How frequently respondent listens to classical music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..Country.: How frequently respondent listens to country music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..EDM.: How frequently respondent listens to EDM music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..Folk.: How frequently respondent listens to Folk music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..Gospel.: How frequently respondent listens to Gospel music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..Hip.hop.: How frequently respondent listens to Hip Hop music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..Jazz.: How frequently respondent listens to Jazz music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..K.pop.: How frequently respondent listens to K-Pop music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..Latin.: How frequently respondent listens to Latin music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..Lofi.: How frequently respondent listens to Lofi music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..Metal.: How frequently respondent listens to Metal music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..Pop.: How frequently respondent listens to Pop music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..R.B.: How frequently respondent listens to R&B music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..Rap.: How frequently respondent listens to Rap music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..Rock.: How frequently respondent listens to Rock music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nFrequency..Video.game.music.: How frequently respondent listens to Video Game music (“Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Never”, “Very Frequently”)\nAnxiety: Self-reported anxiety, on a scale of 0-10\nDepression: Self-reported depression, on a scale of 0-10\nInsomnia: Self-reported insomnia, on a scale of 0-10\nOCD: Self-reported OCD, on a scale of 0-10\nMusic.effects: If music improves, worsens, or has no effect on respondent’s mental health conditions (“Worsen”, “No Effect”, “Improve”)\nPermissions: Permissions to publicize data (“I understand”)\n\nOk cool. I have a better sense of what I’m working with now.\nFor the questions I’m looking to ask, I don’t think I need to keep the Timestamp or Permissions variables. So let’s get them out of my dataset.\n\nmxmh &lt;- results[,c(-1, -33)]\n\nnames(mxmh)\n\n [1] \"Age\"                          \"Primary.streaming.service\"   \n [3] \"Hours.per.day\"                \"While.working\"               \n [5] \"Instrumentalist\"              \"Composer\"                    \n [7] \"Fav.genre\"                    \"Exploratory\"                 \n [9] \"Foreign.languages\"            \"BPM\"                         \n[11] \"Frequency..Classical.\"        \"Frequency..Country.\"         \n[13] \"Frequency..EDM.\"              \"Frequency..Folk.\"            \n[15] \"Frequency..Gospel.\"           \"Frequency..Hip.hop.\"         \n[17] \"Frequency..Jazz.\"             \"Frequency..K.pop.\"           \n[19] \"Frequency..Latin.\"            \"Frequency..Lofi.\"            \n[21] \"Frequency..Metal.\"            \"Frequency..Pop.\"             \n[23] \"Frequency..R.B.\"              \"Frequency..Rap.\"             \n[25] \"Frequency..Rock.\"             \"Frequency..Video.game.music.\"\n[27] \"Anxiety\"                      \"Depression\"                  \n[29] \"Insomnia\"                     \"OCD\"                         \n[31] \"Music.effects\"               \n\n\nWhile I’m at it, I think there might be some NA values in here that I should try to get rid of.\n\nsummary(mxmh)\n\n      Age        Primary.streaming.service Hours.per.day    While.working     \n Min.   :10.00   Length:736                Min.   : 0.000   Length:736        \n 1st Qu.:18.00   Class :character          1st Qu.: 2.000   Class :character  \n Median :21.00   Mode  :character          Median : 3.000   Mode  :character  \n Mean   :25.21                             Mean   : 3.573                     \n 3rd Qu.:28.00                             3rd Qu.: 5.000                     \n Max.   :89.00                             Max.   :24.000                     \n NA's   :1                                                                    \n Instrumentalist      Composer          Fav.genre         Exploratory       \n Length:736         Length:736         Length:736         Length:736        \n Class :character   Class :character   Class :character   Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n Foreign.languages       BPM           Frequency..Classical.\n Length:736         Min.   :0.00e+00   Length:736           \n Class :character   1st Qu.:1.00e+02   Class :character     \n Mode  :character   Median :1.20e+02   Mode  :character     \n                    Mean   :1.59e+06                        \n                    3rd Qu.:1.44e+02                        \n                    Max.   :1.00e+09                        \n                    NA's   :107                             \n Frequency..Country.

    "text": "I have a few areas within the dataset that I’d like to explore, so let’s start with age.\n\n\nFirst, I want to make a general breakdown of the ages of our respondents.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A histogram showing the ages of respondents, in years.\n\n\n\n\nWow, that seems really skewed towards the younger end of our data set, I want to look into that a little more.\n\nmxmh_updatedages &lt;- mxmh %&gt;%\n  filter(Age &gt; 13, Age &lt;= 32) %&gt;%\n  count(Age)\n\nmxmh_updatedages  \n\n   Age  n\n1   14 17\n2   15 21\n3   16 44\n4   17 59\n5   18 85\n6   19 61\n7   20 40\n8   21 52\n9   22 39\n10  23 37\n11  24 20\n12  25 22\n13  26 22\n14  27 18\n15  28 13\n16  29 13\n17  30 11\n18  31 13\n19  32 16\n\n\nSince our data is so skewed towards younger respondents, I’m going to limit our respondents to those between the ages of 14 and 32.\n\nmxmh_cut &lt;- subset(mxmh, Age &gt;= 14 & Age &lt;= 32,\nselect=Age:Music.effects)\n\nNow, I want to see if age can lead to significant differences in respondents’ answers to a couple of questions.\nThe first thing I want to look at is if the primary streaming service of a participant has anything to do with their age. Do younger people listen on “Spotify”? Do older respondents listen on “Youtube” or “Apple Music”?\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Bar graph showing the primary streaming service of respondents, colored by age.\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like Spotify is the most common streaming service across most ages. Apple Music and Youtube Music seem to follow after that.\nThe next thing for age I want to look at is how age and mental health is correlated. Are younger people struggling more than old people?\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Line graphs showing distribution of mental health conditions across ages, faceted by age.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to this, there are a lot of roughly 18-20 year olds with higher self-reports of depression. This could be because that age range has more depression, or due to the fact that we just have a lot of respondents that age.\nNow that we know what ages we have, what streaming services they use, and how theirmental health is, I want to look at how many hours per day respondents listen to music based on their age.\n\n\n\n\n\nLine graph showing the amount of music listened to per day in hours over age, in years, of respondent.\n\n\n\n\nSo, it looks like there’s some variability among how much music respondent’s listen to, but let’s move on to something else.\n\n\n\nNow that we’ve explored how age affects some of the results of the survey, let’s look at various aspects of the mental health part of this survey. I’m counting this as the self-report scores from the Anxiety, Depression, Insomnia, and OCD variables, and the Music.effects variable.\nFirst, I want to see if there are any mental health conditions that are more commonly self-reported by respondents.\n\n\n\n\n\nHistograms showing distribution of each mental health condition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistograms showing distribution of each mental health condition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistograms showing distribution of each mental health condition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistograms showing distribution of each mental health condition\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like Depression and Anxiety have the most self-reports, especially with higher scores, while OCD and Insomnia have higher amounts of self-reports at lower scores, generally.\nI have a few more questions related to some of these mental health conditions in specific. To start with, I’m curious if respondents with higher self-reported Insomnia listen to more music in a day than those who don’t.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Line graph showing hours of music per day and self-reported Insomnia score, colored by if music has an effect on mental health.\n\n\n\n\nOverall, not really. It increases slightly as the insomnia scores do and there’s several outliers, but nothing really significant.\nI want to see if there’s any correlation between different genres and the self-reported Depression scores.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Histogram showing breakdown of Depression self-report scores, colored by Fav.genre.\n\n\n\n\nInteresting, it seems to be evenly distributed among most genres, except for rock and metal music being more prominent. I wonder if I had gender data from my respondents if there would have been any more effects there.\nOne of the last questions about Mental Health I have is if there is a correlation between Anxiety and listening to new music while working. I know music can be very grounding, so I wonder if someone who has a high rating of anxiety would listen to it more while working.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Bar graph showing self-reported Anxiety, colored by if the respondent listened to music while studying or working.”\n\n\n\n\nSo, it does seem that the more people self-report anxiety, the more they listen to music while they work. However, it looks like this result might be because more people rated themselves higher in anxiety in general.\n\n\n\nAlmost there! I had one last question about the data I had. I want to see if different streaming services and different favorite genres overlap. Do the metalheads really love Pandora? Do the rap listeners stay away from Spotify?\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Histogram showing the different favorite genres of participants, colored by preferred streaming service.\n\n\n\n\nOk, cool! It looks like Spotify is overall the most popular, and a significant amount listen to pop music on Youtube music and listen to rock music not on a streaming service at all (maybe CDs?)\nI think that’s enough exploring this dataset for now. Overall, there were a lot of young people and a lot of people who listen on Spotify. The data set also saw a significant amount of people with high self-report scores of depression and anxiety. And a lot of people who listen to Rock music as well."
