I have a better sense of what I'm working with now. \n\nFor the questions I'm looking to ask, I don't think I need to keep the `Timestamp` or `Permissions` variables. So let's get them out of my dataset.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmxmh <- results[,c(-1, -33)]\n\nnames(mxmh)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] \"Age\"                          \"Primary.streaming.service\"   \n [3] \"Hours.per.day\"                \"While.working\"               \n [5] \"Instrumentalist\"              \"Composer\"                    \n [7] \"Fav.genre\"                    \"Exploratory\"                 \n [9] \"Foreign.languages\"            \"BPM\"                         \n[11] \"Frequency..Classical.\"        \"Frequency..Country.\"         \n[13] \"Frequency..EDM.\"              \"Frequency..Folk.\"            \n[15] \"Frequency..Gospel.\"           \"Frequency..Hip.hop.\"         \n[17] \"Frequency..Jazz.\"             \"Frequency..K.pop.\"           \n[19] \"Frequency..Latin.\"            \"Frequency..Lofi.\"            \n[21] \"Frequency..Metal.\"            \"Frequency..Pop.\"             \n[23] \"Frequency..R.B.\"              \"Frequency..Rap.\"             \n[25] \"Frequency..Rock.\"             \"Frequency..Video.game.music.\"\n[27] \"Anxiety\"                      \"Depression\"                  \n[29] \"Insomnia\"                     \"OCD\"                         \n[31] \"Music.effects\"               \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOk cool!

Do younger people listen on \"Spotify\"? Do older respondents listen on \"Youtube\" or \"Apple Music\"?\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Bar graph showing the primary streaming service of respondents, colored by age.](CopyOfmusicxmentalhealthfinal-amandahammers_files/figure-html/fig-bar1-1.png){#fig-bar1 fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe data is very skewed for age, interesting. But it looks like Spotify is the most common streaming service across most ages. Apple Music and Youtube Music seem to follow after that. \n\nThe last thing for age I want to look at is how age and mental health is correlated. Are younger people struggling more than old people?\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Bar graphs showing distribution of mental health conditions across ages, faceted by age.](CopyOfmusicxmentalhealthfinal-amandahammers_files/figure-html/fig-bar2-1.png){#fig-bar2 fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nMy graph looks a little rough, but it seems that respondents between 14-33 have the most variability and highest scores in their self-reported depression. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmxmh_updatedages <- mxmh %>%\n  filter(Age > 13, Age <= 32) %>%\n  count(Age)\n\nmxmh_updatedages  \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n   Age  n\n1   14 17\n2   15 21\n3   16 44\n4   17 59\n5   18 85\n6   19 61\n7   20 40\n8   21 52\n9   22 39\n10  23 37\n11  24 20\n12  25 22\n13  26 22\n14  27 18\n15  28 13\n16  29 13\n17  30 11\n18  31 13\n19  32 16\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSince our data is so skewed towards younger respondents, I'm going to limit our respondents to those between the ages of 14 and 32.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmxmh_cut <- subset(mxmh, Age >= 14 & Age <= 32,\nselect=Age:Music.effects)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Mental Health\n\nNow that we've explored how age affects some of the results of the survey, let's look at various aspects of the mental health part of this survey. I'm counting this as the self-report scores from the `Anxiety`, `Depression`, `Insomnia`, and `OCD` variables, and the `Music.effects` variable. \n\nFirst, I want to see if there are any mental health conditions that are more commonly self-reported by respondents.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Histograms showing distribution of each mental health condition](CopyOfmusicxmentalhealthfinal-amandahammers_files/figure-html/hist-3-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Histograms showing distribution of each mental health condition](CopyOfmusicxmentalhealthfinal-amandahammers_files/figure-html/hist-3-2.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Histograms showing distribution of each mental health condition](CopyOfmusicxmentalhealthfinal-amandahammers_files/figure-html/hist-3-3.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Histograms showing distribution of each mental health condition](CopyOfmusicxmentalhealthfinal-amandahammers_files/figure-html/hist-3-4.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt looks like Depression and Anxiety have the most self-reports, especially with higher scores, while OCD and Insomnia have higher amounts of self-reports at lower scores, generally. \n\nI have a few more questions related to some of these mental health conditions in specific. To start with, I'm curious if respondents with higher self-reported `Insomnia` listen to more music in a day than those who don't.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Line graph showing hours of music per day and self-reported Insomnia score, colored by if music has an effect on mental health.](CopyOfmusicxmentalhealthfinal-amandahammers_files/figure-html/fig-line2-1.png){#fig-line2 fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOverall, not really. It increases slightly as the insomnia scores do and there's several outliers, but nothing really significant.\n\nI want to see if there's any correlation between different genres and the self-reported `Depression` scores. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Histogram showing breakdown of Depression self-report scores, colored by `Fav.genre`.](CopyOfmusicxmentalhealthfinal-amandahammers_files/figure-html/fig-hist4-1.png){#fig-hist4 fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nInteresting, it seems to be evenly distributed among most genres, except for rock and metal music being more prominent. I wonder if I had gender data from my respondents if there would have been any more effects there. \n\nOne of the last questions about Mental Health I have is if there is a correlation between `Anxiety` and listening to new music while working. I know music can be very grounding, so I wonder if someone who has a high rating of anxiety would listen to it more while working.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Bar graph showing self-reported `Anxiety`, colored by if the respondent listened to music while studying or working.\"](CopyOfmusicxmentalhealthfinal-amandahammers_files/figure-html/fig-bar3-1.png){#fig-bar3 fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo, it does seem that the more people self-report anxiety, the more they listen to music while they work. However, it looks like this result might be because more people rated themselves higher in anxiety in general.\n\n\n### Genres\n\nAlmost there! I had one last question about the data I had. I want to see if different streaming services and different favorite genres overlap. Do the metalheads really love Pandora? Do the rap listeners stay away from Spotify?\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Histogram showing the different favorite genres of participants, colored by preferred streaming service.](CopyOfmusicxmentalhealthfinal-amandahammers_files/figure-html/fig-hist7-1.png){#fig-hist7 fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOk, cool! It looks like Spotify is overall the most popular, and a significant amount listen to pop music on Youtube music and listen to rock music not on a streaming service at all (maybe CDs?)\n\nI think that's enough exploring this dataset for now.  Overall, there were a lot of young people and a lot of people who listen on Spotify. The data set also saw a significant amount of people with high self-report scores of depression and anxiety. And a lot of people who listen to Rock music as well.\n\n## End of Spotify Wrapped Pt 2.\n\n# Thank you!!\n\n",
